# Banning-The-Bortions
<br>

&ensp; With the overturning of <b>Roe V. Wade</b>, the United States Supreme Court is currently facing a major backlash. With hundreds of rage-fueled protests being organized nationwide, this blatant violation of a person's "right to privacy <i>(and just their human rights in general)</i>," to anyone seeking an abortion is just another battle in this neverending war against those that society deems as second class citizens.
<br>

&ensp; In order to narrow down the dataset, the decision was made to only focus on those under the age of 25. This is due to the fact that the older a person is, the likelihood that the pregnancy was planned drastically increases. If this person is in need of an abortion, it is most likely due to medical reasons, like endangerment to the fetus carrier's health, or the pregnancy becoming nonviable. A majority of the unintended/unwanted pregnancies occur in those who are under the age of 25. These are the ones who are the most in need of access to safe, legal abortions since they are younger, tend to be less settled <i>(i.e. lacking in finances and other aspects of stability)</i>, and just don't have the desire to be parents yet.
<br>
  
Which is the most important reason of all...
<br>

<b><i>No one should be forced into carrying a fetus to full term against their will.</i></b>

<b>So What Do We Do?</b>
<br>

<p>&ensp; In an attempt to do our part to stand up against this ruling, we decided to create an informative page dedicated to the history of abortions in the U.S. This will include a map that will provide useful information, such as:</p>
<p>&ensp; - The population of each state</p>
<p>&ensp; - The number of abortion clinics in each state. </p>
<p>&ensp; - What the new abortion laws of each state will be and how far into the pregnancy a person can obtain an abortion. (Colorcoded) </p>
<p><i>The latest year of the dataset is 2017, so that's where the trends end, but the predictions of each state's decision on banning abortions is from July of this year.</i></p>
<hr>

<b>How Does It Work?:</b>
<br>

<p><b>Step 1: Build The Database</b></p>
<p>   Using the schema.sql, build the database that will house all of the information from the 2 CSVs provided. Create the 2 tables, upload the CSVs, and then use the rest of the schema to edit the tables to get the final database. The information predicting the new abortion laws from 2022 is included in the schema and will need to be inputted separately as well.</p>
<p><b>Step 2: Launch The Index</b></p>
<p> Using the information gathered, the program will launch the website that will:</p>
<p>&ensp; -Provide links to other pages that include tables of the datasets</p>
<p>&ensp; -Using Leaflet.js, an interactive map will populate and display relevant information. When you click on the state, the marker will provide </p>
<p>&ensp; -Charts and graphs outlining the trends of abortion in the U.S.</p>
<p>&ensp; -Information, like hotlines and websites, for those seeking an abortion.</p>
