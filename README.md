# Banning-The-Bortions
<p>
With the overturning of <b>Roe V. Wade</b>, the United States Supreme Court is currently facing a major backlash. With hundreds of rage-fueled protests being organized nationwide, this blatant violation of a person's "right to privacy <i>(and just their human rights in general)</i>," to anyone seeking an abortion is just another battle in this neverending war against those that society deems as second class citizens.
<br>
In order to narrow down the dataset, the decision was made to only focus on those under the age of 25. This is due to the fact that the older a person is, the likelihood that the pregnancy was planned drastically increases. If this person is in need of an abortion, it is most likely due to medical reasons, like endangerment to the fetus carrier's health, or the pregnancy becoming nonviable. A majority of the unintended/unwanted pregnancies occur in those who are under the age of 25. These are the ones who are the most in need of access to safe, legal abortions since they are younger, tend to be less settled <i>(i.e. lacking in finances and other aspects of stability)</i>, and just don't have the desire to be parents yet... <strong>Which is the most important reason of all.</strong>
<br>
No one should be forced into carrying a fetus to full term against their will.

<b>So What Are We To Do?</b>

In an attempt to do our part to stand up against this ruling, we decided to create an interactive map of the U.S. This map will provide useful information, such as:
- The number of abortion clinics in each state.
- What the new abortion laws of each state will be and how far into the pregnancy a person can obtain an abortion.
- Abortion information from state to state throughout the years.  
<i>The latest year of the dataset is 2017, so that's where the trends end, but the predictions of each state's decision on banning abortions is from July of this year.</i>
