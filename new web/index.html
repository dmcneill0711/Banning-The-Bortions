            <h3>The History of Abortion in the United States</h3>
            <hr>
            <div class="col-6">
            <img src="https://slack-imgs.com/?c=1&o1=ro&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.trust.org%2FcontentAsset%2Fimage%2Fb5d48909-79c3-4f26-a262-ef28e9c40a08%2Fimage%2FResize%2CJpeg%2Fjpeg_q%2Fresize_w%2F1000" alt="Girl in a jacket"style="width:600px;height:400px;"> 
          </div>
            <p>Roe V. Wade was a landmark ruling that legally validated those of possible child-bearing status and granted them the 
            right to their own autonomy. In its passing, the number of illegal abortions dropped down to 13% of what it was in the previous
            years, and the number of injuries and deaths caused by these illegal abortions also dropped significantly. Roe V. Wade also propelled 
            forward the development of these procedures, leading to the increased regulations that protected the safety of the patient seeking to 
            obtain an abortion. With the government on their side, people were able to talk more freely about having an abortion, and the stigma 
            behind getting an abortion diminished. In the 1990s, when more and more households needed to become a dual-income earning one to maintain
            their livelihoods, and when more and more child-bearing individuals started entering the workforce, the idea of having children took
            a backseat to figuring out what they really wanted in life. This trend of choosing self over blindly following the ideals pushed unto 
            them from the previous generations grew, coupled with the increased access to sex information and education via the internet, has lead to
            the steady decline of the total number of proceedures sought out each passing year.</p> 
            <p><i>In fact, the number of abortions hit a record low in 2017.</i></p>
            <p>Now, with the overturning of Roe V. Wade, the United States Supreme Court is currently facing a major backlash. </p>
            <p>With hundreds of rage-fueled protests being organized nationwide, this blatant violation of one's right to privacy to anyone 
            seeking an abortion is just another battle in this never-ending war against those that want to control what they don't understand.</p>
            <p>To support those in need, we created this informative page. Below is a map of all of the states, the banned status of abortions in
            that state, and its general limitations. Also included are the links to various organizations that are dedicated to fighting this 
            injustice. And even if you aren't in need of an abortion, a lot of these places are non-profits and are always looking for donations 
            that will allow them to keep providing their services.</p>
